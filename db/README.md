# How to set up the DB.
Create a db called "mtg_cards"
Open SQL Ace
Create a new db called "mtg_cards" using the add database button.
Once created go to File > Import and select the file that is in the folder this readme is in.
Let mySQL sort it out and you will have a cards table with all of the data used on the collector app. 

Any issues slack me / shout me. 

Cheers then !
