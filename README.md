# Magic The Gathering Card Collector App
PHP collector app project for iO Academy. 

You can view cards in the app, it takes info from the DB and displays them on the page on a card back using PHP & CSS to make the card. 

You can create cards using the create card button, it has some required fields, they are the following:
- Title
- Card Color
- Card Rarity

There is a link to a explainer for MTG cards on the create card page you can use as a reference.

Enjoy & make some cool cards!
